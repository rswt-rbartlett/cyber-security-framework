# Introduction
Most Trusts should be able and probably need to build upon the Foundations measures set out in the Standard.  As Trusts grow the number of systems used and the quantity of personal data gathered also grows. This increases the level of risk, which necessitates a stronger set of controls to mitigate that increased risk.  To support Trusts in meeting the GDPR definition of "appropriate technical and organisational measures" (taking into account cost and risk), three maturity levels have been defined which are commensurate with Trusts of different resources and complexity.

1. [Foundations](/Levels/Foundations.md) (all Trusts should meet this level or be prioritising working towards it)
2. [Structured](/Levels/Structured.md) (Trusts which use a small number of cloud services and have no on-premises infrastructure should meet this level) 
3. [Integrated](/Levels/Integrated.md) (Trusts with significant on-premises infrastructure and their own internal IT staff should meet this level).

## Cyber Insurance pre-requisites
If you are procuring Cyber Insurance there are pre-requisite security controls the insurance provider will expect. To support Trusts a [list](./Levels/cyber-insurance-prerequisites.md) has been compiled of the insurer requirements and the relevant page of the framework.

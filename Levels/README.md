# Introduction
To allow Trusts to engage with this framework regardless of their resources the recommendations are broken down into three maturity levels.  Each level is proportionate to a Trust with the corresponding level of resource, and no Trust should find these recommendations unduly onerous. This approach reflects the requirement under UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to implement **appropriate** technical and organisational measures, including taking into account the cost of implementation.

All Trusts regardless of size will benefit from improving the maturity of their security controls, but these levels are a guide to where your Trust should be, or working towards as a priority. Click on the relevant level to see a list of the recommendations and the corresponding resources.

1. [Foundations](./Levels/Foundations.md) (all Trusts should meet this level or be prioritising working towards it)
2. [Structured](./Levels/Structured.md) (Trusts which use a small number of cloud services and have no on-premises infrastructure should meet this level) 
3. [Integrated](./Levels/Integrated.md) (Trusts with significant on-premises infrastructure and their own internal IT staff should meet this level).

## Cyber Insurance pre-requisites
If you are procuring Cyber Insurance there are pre-requisite security controls the insurance provider will expect. To support Trusts a [list](./Levels/cyber-insurance-prerequisites.md) has been compiled of the insurer requirements and the relevant page of the framework.

# Introduction
Reflecting the proportionality principle of the UK GDPR the standard set out in the framework should be considered

All Trusts regardless of size will benefit from improving the maturity of their security controls, but these levels are a guide to where your Trust should be, or working towards as a priority. Click on the relevant level to see a list of the recommendations and the corresponding resources.

1. [Foundations](/Levels/Foundations.md) (all Trusts should meet this level or be prioritising working towards it)
2. [Structured](/Levels/Structured.md) (Trusts which use a small number of cloud services and have no on-premises infrastructure should meet this level) 
3. [Integrated](/Levels/Integrated.md) (Trusts with significant on-premises infrastructure and their own internal IT staff should meet this level).

# cyber-security-framework
 A Cyber Security Framework for The Wildlife Trusts

# Introduction
This framework is written to be proportional, following the principle of Article 32 of the UK GDPR to "implement appropriate technical and organisational measures", taking into account factors including risk and the costs of implementation.  The framework is based on the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) '10 Steps to Cyber Security', and each of the steps applies to all Trusts, with the effort and skills required being proportional to the resource and size of the Trust.

Each of the 10 steps below is linked to the accompanying guidance which supports Trusts in implementing the measures.

In addition to these measures there is a Maturity Model which suggests the extent of the measures Trusts should take in meeting this standard dependent on the scope of their information systems and the resultant risks.

1. Risk management
	- Cyber risk is integrated into Trust risk management processes and procedures
	- Risk scope including information assets, systems and suppliers is documented and reviewed periodically
2. Engagement and training
	- Senior Management visibly support Trust cyber risk controls and demonstrate good cyber hygiene 
	- Responsibilities for cyber security are documented in an information security or other Trust policy
	- Appropriate steps are taken to make staff aware of cyber risk and their part in managing those risks
3. Asset management
	- An up to date record is kept of Data and Technology Assets
4. Supply chain security
	- Cyber security is embedded into procurement
5. Architecture and configuration
	- Trust email domains are configured to prevent spoofing
	- Effective endpoint protection is installed and managed on all Trust end user devices
6. Vulnerability management
	- All systems are patched and updated periodically and testing validates that all systems are free of vulnerabilities
7. Identity and access management
	- Trusts limit access to personal data to authorised staff only and regularly review usersâ€™ access rights.
	- Trusts use multi-factor authentication or equivalent controls to reduce the risk of unauthorised access
	- Trusts restrict privileged access to those who need it and using a separate individually named account 
8. Data security
	- Trusts ensure their systems encrypt all personal data at rest and in transit
	- Trusts backup their data according to its value and sensitivity, protect that backup from attack and test it periodically
9. Logging and monitoring
	- Trusts systems log authentication and system administration events
10. Incident management
	- Trusts have an Incident Response Plan which would enable a prompt and effective response to a serious cyber incident

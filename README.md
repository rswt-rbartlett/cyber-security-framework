# cyber-security-framework
A Cyber Security Framework for The Wildlife Trusts

# Introduction
This framework sets out a standard for Cyber Security for The Wildlife Trusts to support the whole federation meeting legislative and regulatory requirements. It is written to be proportional, following the principle of [Article 32](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/32) of the UK GDPR to "implement appropriate technical and organisational measures", taking into account factors including risk and the costs of implementation.

The framework is based on the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) ['10 Steps to Cyber Security'](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps) and the steps apply to all Trusts, with the effort and skills required being proportional to the resource and size of the Trust. Each step is linked to the accompanying guidance, templates and technical resources which support Trusts in implementing the measures.

In addition to the standard set out below a [Maturity Model](/Levels/README.md#introduction) describes the measures Trusts should take in meeting this standard, dependent on the scope of their information systems and the resultant risks.

## Working with suppliers
The controls listed in this framework can be implemented by Trust staff, third party suppliers, or a combination of the two. In this vital that each Trust has a clear understanding of which party is responsible for the control, and where a supplier is responsible that is explicit in the agreement with them.  Otherwise it is possible for unshared assumptions on both sides to lead to critical responsibilities being missed, leading to increased risk or security breaches.

To support Trusts in reaching an understanding about who is responsible for each control an illustration [Shared Responsibility Model](/1-Understand-your-risks/shared-responsibility-model.md) has been developed to support conversations and decision making in this area.

# The Standard
Below are statements under each of the 10 Steps with which Trusts can demonstrate compliance.

1. Risk management
	- Cyber risk is [integrated](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-01-Risk-Management.md#integrating-cyber-risk-management) into Trust risk management processes and procedures
	- Risk scope including information assets, systems and suppliers is [documented](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-01-Risk-Management.md#define-scope) and reviewed periodically
2. Engagement and training
	- Senior Management [visibly support](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-02-Engagement-and-Training.md#top-down-support) Trust cyber risk controls and demonstrate good cyber hygiene 
	- Responsibilities for cyber security are [documented](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-02-Engagement-and-Training.md#information-security-policies) in an information security or other Trust policy
	- Appropriate steps are taken to [make staff aware](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-02-Engagement-and-Training.md#security-awareness) of cyber risk and their part in managing those risks
3. Asset management
	- An up to date record is kept of [Data](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-03-Asset-Management.md#data-assets) and [Technology](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-03-Asset-Management.md#technology-assets) Assets
4. Supply chain security
	- Cyber security is [embedded](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-04-Supply-Chain-Security.md#embed-security-into-procurement) into procurement
5. Architecture and configuration
	- Trust email domains are [configured](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-05-Architecture-and-Configuration.md#make-it-harder-to-spoof-your-email-domain) to prevent spoofing
	- Effective endpoint protection is [installed](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-05-Architecture-and-Configuration.md#install-effective-endpoint-protection) on all Trust end user devices
6. Vulnerability management
	- All systems are [patched and updated](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-06-Vulnerability-Management.md#update-systems) periodically and testing validates that all systems are [free of vulnerabilities](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-06-Vulnerability-Management.md#scan-for-vulnerabilities)
7. Identity and access management
	- Trusts [limit access](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-07-Identity-and-Access-Management.md#decide-who-needs-access-to-what-and-how) to personal data to authorised staff only and regularly [review](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-07-Identity-and-Access-Management.md#maintain-your-identities) usersâ€™ access rights
	- Trusts use [multi-factor authentication](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-07-Identity-and-Access-Management.md#implement-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-for-all-remote-access) or equivalent controls to reduce the risk of unauthorised access
	- Trusts [restrict privileged access](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-07-Identity-and-Access-Management.md#separate-admin-accounts-and-protect-them) to those who need it and using a separate individually named account 
8. Data security
	- Trusts ensure their systems [encrypt](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-08-Data-Security.md#protect-data-with-encryption) all personal data at rest and in transit
	- Trusts [backup](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-08-Data-Security.md#backup-your-data) their data according to its value and sensitivity, protect that backup from attack and test it periodically
9. Logging and monitoring
	- Trusts systems [log](/3-Prepare-for-incidents/Step-09-Logging-and-monitoring.md#log-what-matters) authentication and system administration events
10. Incident management
	- Trusts have an [Incident Response Plan](/3-Prepare-for-incidents/Step-10-Incident-management.md#develop-an-incident-response-plan) which would enable a prompt and effective response to a serious cyber incident

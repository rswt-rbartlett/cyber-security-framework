# The threat of phishing

# Context
Tricking the reader into clicking on a link end entering their credentials or opening an infected attachment is still one of the biggest cyber security risks for any Wildlife Trust.  Recently phishing was used to successfully attack Cisco, one of the biggest technology companies in the world.  Testing at RSWT revealed that staff were most likely to click on a phishing link if they were in a hurry, just trying to clear their inbox or quickly processing email whilst travelling. 

# Recommendation
- [ ] To reduce the chances of being caught out by a phishing email, if the sender asks you to click on a link, **slow down**. 
- [ ] Rather than feeling rushed read that email later, when you can give yourself a bit more time to look at the message, [check who sent it and where the actually link goes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-phishing#office-SecondaryMessaging-c5ggvem).

> Social engineering (the method hackers use to manipulate their victims) relies on triggering action without thought, in response to a feeling of urgency and/or fear.

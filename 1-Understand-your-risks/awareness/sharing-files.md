# The problem with sharing files via email
As we review quarantined emails the ICT team and myself have noticed that a lot of people are sharing files as email attachments. This isn't a good idea for a number of reasons.  

1. Our security systems will block emails with zip file attachments, because they're frequently used to deliver some really unpleasant ransomware.  This means your email is delayed, and ICT has to review those emails before releasing them.
2. Once you've sent someone a file there are now two copies, the one you're potentially still working on, and the one they've received.  The more you email that file the more versions of it exist, which can lead to confusion.
3. Once you email someone a file you have no sight of or control over who reads it.  If it contained sensitive or confidential information that could lead to a data breach.

# The solution
The good news is there are much better ways to share files which are easy to use, more secure, give you more control over your files, and work for everyone (wherever they are and regardless of whether they have a Microsoft 365 subscription).
 
Firstly, to share files, and to make sure they're safe, they should only be stored in one of two locations;

1. OneDrive for Business if it's content only you're working on (OneDrive is the modern version of the old 'home drive'), or,
2. SharePoint Documents or Teams Files if they're content other people need to see/collaborate on.

If you need to store your files elsewhere please contact me as there are data loss/exposure risks from storing files in other locations (whether those are local solutions like external drives, pen drives or cloud services like Dropbox).  I'm not saying it's impossible to store files elsewhere but we should have a discussion about backup, access controls etc. to make sure you're not inadvertently exposing yourself or your Trust data to unnecessary risk!

Having stored your files in one of those two locations, instead of **emailing the file** you just **share a link to it**, which has the following advantages:

1. You can control who can see it, with the choices being only the recipients, anyone in your (or their) organisation, or anyone with the link (allowing them to forward the email to others).
2. You can control whether they can read, edit, suggest changes or even download the file.
3. You can set an expiry date on the link so it's only available for a specific period of time, after which the link no longer works.

The upside of the whole thing is they're accessing your file, so if you change it they see the changes, if you delete it they lose access to it instantly.  You retain control, they get live access to the current version.

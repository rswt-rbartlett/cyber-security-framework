# Security Alert for any Trusts using MOVEit file transfer software

MOVEit is a secure file transfer system which has a serious vulnerability which was discovered and used by cyber-criminals before it could be patched by the vendor (Progress, formerly Ipswitch). If any of partner organisations use MOVEit to transfer data from your Trust to them you should consider that data at risk.

Based on the assessment by Mandiant if you use this software there is a high proability that data has been stolen, and potentially backdoors installed on the system running MOVEit.  In this scenario, do not delete any logs as these are vital to understanding the extent of data theft.

**Recommendation**: If your Trust uses this software please read [this article](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023) from Progress at and follow the instructions.

**Postscript**: As of 12th July the impact of this breach numbered 296 organizations and 18,154,787 individuals.

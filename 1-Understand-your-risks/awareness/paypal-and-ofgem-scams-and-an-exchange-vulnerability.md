# Scams currently in circulation

There are two scams which are active in the UK at the moment which your staff should be aware of.

1. A Paypal phishing scam which uses Paypal invoices to trick the victim into calling a free number, where someone will try and trick them into downloading remote support software which gives them control of the victim machine.  See [PayPal Phishing Scam Uses Invoices Sent Via PayPal â€“ Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/paypal-phishing-scam-uses-invoices-sent-via-paypal/) for more details of the scam, and warn staff to login to their Paypal account and check for invoices there, rather than clicking on a link in an email (even when it comes from Paypal).
2. An Ofgem scam where the victim receives an email with the subject line "Claim your bill rebate now", but there is no rebate and the link is a phishing link designed to steal credentials.  See [Warning as criminals exploit cost of living crisis to target the public with energy rebate scams | Action Fraud](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/alert/energyrebatescam) for more details.

# New Exchange Vulnerabilities

There are two new vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server ([CVE-2022-41040](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41040) and [CVE-2022-41082](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41082)).  If you are running Exchange Server 2013, 2016 or 2019 on premises or in hybrid mode, and particularly if your Exchange server is accessible from the internet (e.g. you are offering Outlook Web Access) then you should consider the following **as a matter of urgency**:

1. Stop presenting Outlook Web Access to the internet.
2. Restrict all public access to the server using Geo-IP access rules to block countries outside the UK
3. Consider other mitigation steps (be aware the Microsoft mitigation steps have already been bypassed, alternative mitigation has been [proposed](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1576922677675102208)). 

If you have any questions about these scams or the Exchange vulnerabilities (already codenamed 'ProxyNotShell'!) please let me know.

# The Lockbit ransomware group
The NCSC has recently issued their threat assessment for Q2 (Apr-Jun 2022) listing the top 10 ransomware groups, and the one of most relevance to the Wildlife Trusts is Lockbit. Lockbit have targeted the charity sector in the last quarter, and are one of three ransomware groups presenting a significant threat to the UK  (along with Hive and ALPHV/BlackCat, which are not known to have targeted the charity sector). 

Lockbit are probably based in Russia, and are ranked second in the NCSC list.  They operate a 'Ransomware as a Service' model (which means there are a lot more people using their ransomware toolkit) and they have a data leak site (which for victims presents the double threat of ransomware AND cyber extortion). 

# Their methodology
The Kaspersky [guide](https://securelist.com/modern-ransomware-groups-ttps/106824/) to modern ransomware groupsâ€™ TTPs identifies two initial access methods used by the Lockbit group:

1. External remote access (e.g. Remote Desktop Protocol or VPN), and
2. Exploitation of public facing applications (e.g. web applications). 

This highlights the importance of securing your remote access and public facing applications, alongside dealing with the more commonly recognised threats of phishing and viruses.

# Recommendation
Kaspersky recommends a number of measures in their report including those recently highlighted in the "Cyber threats and recommended mitigations" post to Wildnet last month (patch known vulnerabilities, enable MFA etc.) and I would strongly recommend all Trusts review those recommendations and follow them as far as possible.

As ever, if you are struggling to understand or implement recommendations or understand the risks to your Trusts please email me.

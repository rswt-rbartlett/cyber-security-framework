# Ransomware - it could be you
**Tl;dr Ransomware is a direct threat to all Wildlife Trusts**

# Context
You may have the [news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60826263) recently that the Scottish Association for Mental Health was hit by a cyber-attack.  The offenders were a ransomware group calling themselves RansomEXX, who stole 12.5GB of files before encrypting everything.  The data they stole included Trustee Application forms containing personal data and scans of Trustee passports and driving licenses, which they then leaked onto the dark web, in an effort to force the charity to pay for the decryption key.  Over two weeks after the attack, SAMH email and national phone lines were still disrupted.

The CEO of the charity commented 
> "It is difficult to understand why anyone would deliberately try to disrupt the work of an organisation that is relied on by people at their most vulnerable". 

I can empathise with the CEO, but the statement demonstrates a worrying lack of understanding of how cyber-criminals work.

**They don't care who you are, if you have a vulnerability, they will exploit it.**

# Ransomware scenarios
Cyber-crime gangs work not by targeting specific organisations based on their size or nature, but by opportunity. Their attacks are indiscriminate and opportunistic.  

- If a member of your staff clicks a link in a phishing email and enters their credentials and you don't have Multi-Factor Authentication; then a ransomware gang will at some point try and attack your organisation.
- If you haven't patched your firewall to fix the serious vulnerability the vendor just published, a ransomware gang will at some point attack your organisation.

No matter how large or small you are, no matter if you are a charity, a hospital or a global banking corporation, if you are vulnerable, they will attack you.  The important thing is not to be vulnerable, which means taking some simple precautions;

# Recommendations
- [ ] Patch your systems
- [ ] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all remotely accessible systems (including cloud services)
- [ ] Backup your data and hold those backups offline so you can recover if you are hit by ransomware

I'm developing a cyber security framework to support Trusts of all sizes take appropriate precautions, if you're interested in being involved, if you are concerned about your own Trusts security, please get in touch and I'll be happy to support you.

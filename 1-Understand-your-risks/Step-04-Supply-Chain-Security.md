# Understand your risks
# Step 4. Supply chain security

Your suppliers are a big part of your security risk, especially for smaller Trusts who rely almost entirely on suppliers for their IT services.  Suppliers may be data processors for personal data your Trust is the data controller for. They may also have access to your systems and data (e.g. if they provide you with IT Technical Support) and their security is essential to your security.  Some of the largest breaches in the last three years were caused by a breach of a company who provides services to thousands of customer organisations (see below for supply chain security considerations).

## Review supplier security risk 
Reviewing a suppliers security is challenging without some technical input, but a [Supplier Assurance Questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ShareFormPage.aspx?id=FGSXBloaNEOsBOerQ0QtNvqeUsTWMVFAkfvUqkmlpUtUN1JMTkw2SURPT0pFRVIxOFpKN1BJODlDNC4u&sharetoken=7yG2wCqR84qa3WpTM5tY) template is available in Microsoft Forms which you can use to survey a supplier.  If you need support reviewing their responses please contact the Strategic Lead for Information Security.

Security assessments of the following suppliers are available from RSWT;
- Breathe HR
- Charity CRM
- MangoApps
- Xledger
- Engaging Networks

## Embed security into procurement
When buying new products or services it is important to consider the security of those systems alongside cost, functionality, compatability and integration with existing systems.  The template IT Information Security Policy sets out the RSWT [approach](/1-Understand-your-risks/it-information-security-policy.md#system-acquisition-and-development) to system procurement.  Particular care should be taken when procuring products or services which will hold personal or personal sensitive data.  If you need support in procuring a new system the Strategic Lead for Information Security at RSWT is able to undertake suppliers reviews on your behalf.

## Work with your suppliers to improve security
All Trusts rely to some extent on third parties and Trusts with less internal IT resource will rely more on their third parties. To support you in assessing how effective your supplier is at maintaining and improving your information security, below are some key indicators of success and conversations you should be having.

### Indicators of success
The following controls should be implemented or in the process of being implemented at your Trust;
- Multi-Factor Authentication for all internet accessible services (e.g. cloud services and remote access to office systems)
- Centrally managed endpoint protection (anti-virus)
- Centrally managed software updates (including computers, servers and any network infrastructure like routers, firewalls and wireless)
- Backup of all critical Trust data somewhere safe

## Topics of conversation
- The supplier should be asking you about what data and services are most important to you and discussing how to protect those.
- They should be proactively advising you where there are opportunities to improve your security (e.g. when new features are launched for services or systems you already use, or where new threats require new responses).
- If you suffer from a security incident (e.g. a user account is compromised in a phishing attack or a laptop infected with malware) your supplier should be talking to you about how to prevent future recurrences.

Different suppliers take different approaches, with some more passive than others.  In the short term you could meet with your supplier and discuss how they can support you in implementing the [recommended mitigation](/1-Understand-your-risks/awareness/cyber-threats-and-recommended-mitigations.md#recommended-mitigation) from the August 2022 briefing to Chief Executives.  In the longer term you should review with your supplier where you are in comparison to the [maturity level](https://github.com/rswt-rbartlett/cyber-security-framework#approach) you are trying to reach.

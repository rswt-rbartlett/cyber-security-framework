# Understand your risks
# Step 2. Engagement and training

## Top down support
Because cyber security risks are so impacted by people's behaviour it's particularly important that there is a message from the top of the Trust which encourages the **right**  behaviours.  Those include;
- Completing cyber security awareness training, 
- Following policies and procedures, and 
- Reporting something if it's concern

It's vital that executives and senior managers lead by example, and are not seen to be exceptions to the rule.

## Information Security Policies
As with risk management you should integrate information security policy into your existing policies (e.g. Health and Safety, Procurement etc.)  Policies should be proportionate, so if you've only got a three page Staff Policy which covers everything your staff are expected to do, your Information Security Policy should be one or two paragraphs in there.  

Trust which only have a small policy bundle should consider incorporating the following information security elements;
- Trust Responsibilities
  - All computers and devices used to access Trust data should;
    - have the latest security updates installed no more than 14 days after release
    - be secured with a password (for computers) or PIN (for smartphones and tablets)
    - be protected by endpoint protection software
  - All access to confidential and personal data should be protected by access control using individual user accounts managed by the Trust
  - All Trust data should be backed up according to its value to the organisation and the impact if it were lost
  - All staff and others with access to confidential data should be informed of their responsibilities and the threats they should be aware of.
- Individual Responsibilities
  - If you think someone has accessed your account or a computer is infected report this as a breach to your IT team or provider
  - Don't use Trust systems to harass, bully or abuse people or break the law.
  - Take particular care of any confidential information you have access to, especially personal information.
  - Think before you copy, share or upload confidential data, especially outside the Trust.

If you have a set of existing staff policies and need to refresh or replace your existing Information Security Policies you can use the policies below as templates, adapting them as required.  
- [IT Information Security Policy](./it-information-security-policy.md) which sets out Trust level requirements which the Executive or Senior Management are responsible for meeting,
- [Staff Information Security Policy](./staff-information-security-policy.md), which sets out the individual requirements which all staff should be expected to meet.

## Training
Whilst technical controls do the bulk of the work, Trust staff are a key defense, and training is a vital part of maintaining that defense.
All staff should be given cyber security training during their probation, and ideally regularly after that, depending on their role and the level of access they have to personal or strictly confidential information.

You may already have a package of training courses which includes a cyber security awareness course, if not below are two free courses which have been evaluated and assessed as suitable.  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) course can also be modified to fit your purposes and hosted on your own Learning Management System (LMS).

## Security awareness
Security awareness material can be a complement to initial or refresher training, or an alternative if you chose not to require staff to complete a training course.  They make staff aware of changes to risks which affect them, so they can act accordingly.  Changes could be a new threat they should be aware of so they can recognise it, or a new feature which makes it easier for them to secure their data and devices.  Below are the Security Briefings posted to Wildnet broken down into those for all staff, and those for specific audiences. Whenever a new security briefing is posted to Wildnet it will be copied here for ease of access and re-use by any Trust.

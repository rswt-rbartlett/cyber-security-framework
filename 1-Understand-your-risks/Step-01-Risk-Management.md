# Understand your risks
# Step 1. Risk management

## Integrating Cyber Risk Management 
Cyber risks are just one of many risks any Trust will face.  You will already have a risk management process which you use to manage operational and strategic risk, and you should integrate cyber security risk into that framework.  It's important that everyone from the Trustees to operational staff see Cyber Risk as not something special for technical people to manage, but just another risk everyone has a part to play in addressing (the same as Health and Safety risk).  

## Define Scope
To understanding the scope of your cyber risk follow the steps below.
- Make a list of the systems, services or technology you use for HR, Finance, Payroll, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Geographic Information System (GIS) and Land/field/forest management.  This tells you where your key information assets are, which most need protecting.
- Include third party services and suppliers in that list. You're not responsible for the technical security of those services but you do still have a responsibility[^1] for your information, your staff who use the services and the devices they use to do so.
- Add the systems or services you use for email, collaboration, file storage, email marketing, digital fundraising, event management, data visualisation and analysis, web hosting and server hosting.  These are services you depend on to run your Trust and contain data you need to protect.

## Common risks 
All Trusts will share some common cyber security risks as they are similar in structure and purpose and some risks are systemic.

To help you get started, below is a list of risks, their consequences and known effective mitigations.  You can use this as the basis for your own cyber security risks or compare them against those you have already logged.

| Risk | Description | Consequences | Mitigation options |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Ransomware | All on-premises and cloud data is encrypted in a ransomware attack | Widespread loss of IT services, reputational damage, financial impact including recovery costs and regulatory penalties | Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all remote access |
| Cyber Extortion | An attacker threatens to release data stolen from a Trust system on a public website unless a payment is made | Reputational damage, financial impact including forensic investigation costs and potential regulatory penalties. | Require MFA for all remote access|
| Business Email Compromise | A member of staff is tricked into authorising a transfer of funds into a criminals account. | Reputational damage, financial impact including unauthorised redirection of funds and forensic investigation costs. | Implement MFA for financial systems and dual release controls for money transfers. |
| Disclosure from unencrypted portable device | An unencrypted Trust or personal laptop tablet or phone is lost or stolen leading to the disclosure of PII or strictly confidential information. | Reputational damage, financial impact including potential regulatory penalties. | Employ the free encryption available on all Windows, Mac OS, iOS and Android devices. |
| Insider attack | A current or ex-member of staff misuses their access to data to disclose, modify or destroy data. | Reputational damage, financial impact including forensic investigation costs and potential regulatory penalties. | Implement logging to detect unusual user behaviour. |
| Human error | Data is lost, disclosed or modified due to human error by a member of staff. | Reputational damage, financial impact including potential regulatory penalties. | Review staff skills, permissions and key system UI controls. |

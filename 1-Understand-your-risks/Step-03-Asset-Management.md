# Understand your risks
# Step 3. Asset management 
> Cyber Essentials consideration (questions A2.4-2.9, A6.2.1-6.2.4)

You can only protect what you know exists.  If a laptop, server or a directory full of personal data is forgotten then it won't be protected, and could be the cause of a serious cyber security breach.  You should have a record of the following different types of asset.

## Technology assets
Technology assets include laptops, computers, servers, smartphones, tablets, networking equipment etc.  This is needed to understand where to apply protections and verify that they work (e.g. configure a system to automatically update and verify that it is up to date).

You may be able to source this from existing financial asset records or purchasing records.

## Data assets 
Data assets include HR, Finance, Payroll, CRM and GIS data. Knowing where the most important and sensitive data is allows you to prioritise the protection of that data.

> **Note:** [Article 30](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/documentation/what-do-we-need-to-document-under-article-30-of-the-gdpr/) of the UK GDPR requires organisations to hold records of processing including the purpose of processing, the categories of individuals, categories or personal data and who it will be shared with.  These are also known as an 'Information Asset Register'. If you don't already have an Information Asset Register which records this you can develop one as part of this process.
 
## Identities 
Identities are the user accounts or credentials which allow access to your systems and data.  These might be on local servers, a local directory, or accounts on cloud services.

These identities are vital as they are the keys to your data, and you need to make sure you know:
- where they are, 
- that only authorised people have them, and 
- if they're lost or stolen so you can disable them.

This list is required for effective [Identity and access management](/2-Implement-appropriate-mitigations/Step-07-Identity-and-Access-Management.md)

## Suppliers 
Your suppliers are those companies which provide IT services such as HR, Payroll, CRM, email and collaboration services.  

Understanding which suppliers you use for which purpose is helpful when measuring [supply chain risk](./Step-04-Supply-Chain-Security.md#review-supplier-security-risk) and as part of information asset managment (some Trusts may have all their information assets hosted by suppliers).

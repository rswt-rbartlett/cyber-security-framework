# Shared Responsibility Model
This model has been developed to help Trusts work with their IT suppliers to map out which party is responsible for which area of cyber security.  Some responsibilities can be shared, so those are broken down into specific tasks so Trusts can ensure all areas are covered and there are no gaps.

For each of the responsibilities below, discuss with your supplier whether those are wholly outsourced to them, wholly the responsibility of Trust staff, or a shared responsibility where each understakes specific tasks.  Those decisions should be documented within your contract with the third party (or parties), and can also be part of your [Information Security Policy](/1-Understand-your-risks/Step-02-Engagement-and-Training.md#information-security-policies).

| Responsibility | Trust | Supplier |
| ------ | :---: |  :---: |
| [Identify and mitigate information security risk](#identify-and-mitigate-information-security-risk) |  |  |
| Set Information Security Policy | &#10004; | &#10006; | &#10006; |
| [Validate Security Controls and Compliance](#validate-security-controls-and-compliance) |  |  |
| [Update software](#update-software) |  |  |
| [Manage and maintain network controls](#manage-and-maintain-network-controls) |  |  |
| [Manage user accounts and permissions](#manage-user-accounts-and-permissions) |  |  |
| Manage files and data  | &#10004; | &#10006; | &#10006; |

Two responsibilities above are pre-determined to be a Trust responsibility, because they are both activities which **cannot** be outsourced.
1. Set Information Security Policy.  Whilst a Trust might take technical advice from internal IT staff or third party suppliers, the decisions around how data and systems are protected, what staff can and cannot do, how information is classified and what what to do in the event of a security incident must be made by Trust senior management.  No technical IT knowledge is required to make those decisions, they are about balancing risk and usability, understanding what data the Trust holds and it's value.
2. Manage files and data. The day to day management of Trust files and data are always the responsibility of Trust staff out of operational necessity.  It is important that all staff understand their responsibilities in this area, and senior management have made decisions about the handling of data, informed by an understanding of basic Data Protection principles.
